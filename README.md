# Blitz Repackager

This is currently a WIP. If you want something to run raw on linux check out [Mobalytics Repackager](https://github.com/sekwah41/mobalytics-repackager)


## This likely wont work without a lot of effort
As a lot of the parts require native pre-compiled bundles from blitz unlike mobalytics, we cannot as easily edit a lot of them.

If anything for the effort id be putting into this I would be better off making my own semi-open source build client.
